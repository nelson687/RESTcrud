Rest service:
The application dependencies are managed by maven, to build and run the tests run: mvn clean install.

As the application doesn't use a database (as per test's request), the app has a service to create a few objects (songs, albums, etc) in memory injecting a ServletContext, to do this run:
http://localhost:8080/webapi/init
If the load is successful the response will be: "{status: Data successfully loaded}"
This service must be executed any time the app is deployed or tomcat restarted, otherwise you won't receive any results.


Song api:
*get a song by its id (http GET):
http://localhost:8080/webapi/song/get?id=0
If the init service was executed before, you'll get a song in json format as the response. (the init service only loads one song, therefore if you search for id=1 you will receive an empty json).

*search song (http GET):
	bySongName:
	http://localhost:8080/webapi/song/search?name=name (the init service loads one song with name "Song Name")
	returns a json array with all the coincidences.

	byArtistName:
	http://localhost:8080/webapi/song/search?artist=artist (the init service loads one song with artist name "Artist Name")
	returns a json array with all the coincidences.

	byGenre:
	http://localhost:8080/webapi/song/search?genre=rock (the init service loads one song with genre "rock")
	returns a json array with all the coincidences.
